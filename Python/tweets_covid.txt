The White House has taken down the tents where people who were entering used to have to be tested for Covid symptoms. The strategy is clear: Pretend the pandemic is gone, and our Covid crisis will be over. Truth be damned. It‚Äôs idiotic and suicidal.
The left is really panicked about the economy coming back. Ruins their narrative.  Expect more calls to shutdown states again citing supposed COVID concerns. No tax dollars to states that refuse to open.
Just because some people and news outlets have moved on from coronavirus doesn‚Äôt mean the virus is gone. We are still in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has claimed more than 116,000 American lives.   Wear a mask.
it‚Äôs weird watching people just decide the pandemic is over
BREAKING: Trump just lied on Hannity saying coronavirus doesn‚Äôt effect young people. It‚Äôs an impeachable lie.
Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are ‚Äúdown to‚Äù fewer than 750 a day.  That's more than 20,000 a month ‚Äî and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.  It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k

Bolton‚Äôs book revealing a fumbling, bumbling, angry, corrupt, racist, vengeful, and ignorant President .. a President with a personality poised to botch a coming pandemic, much of which could have been mitigated by listening to simple science-My question-Why did he wait to share?
If I wear a mask I lower my chances of getting, or giving, COVID.  If you wear a mask, you lower your chances of getting, or giving, COVID.  If we both wear masks. Neither of us is getting, or giving, COVID.  You know. Rocket science.
All the Depression  experts yesterday, who were the Covid experts day before, are today Defence and Warfare experts üôè #humanityrip
Just thinking about the nurses wearing garbage bags, and using the same masks over &amp; over in NY during the worst of the pandemic, or public school teachers being disparaged &amp; denigrated in public discourse &amp; having to buy their own supplies, and still showing up to do their jobs. https://t.co/RdXrgAG4uK
So let me get this straight: We can't find the money to extend unemployment benefits during a pandemic, but we spend $115,000,000,000 a year on police?
The media has amplified the voices of fear and panic. They are using COVID-19 to push other agendas.  Please retweet this and follow my account as I am spreading facts and science. We need to amplify it   Together we can get back to normal.  And I mean normal, not a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù.

Trump‚Äôs coronavirus coverup is the biggest scandal in American history.
‚ÄùThese outbreaks are manifestations of our dangerously unbalanced relationship with nature‚Äù.  Pandemics like COVID 19 are a result from destruction of nature according to UN and WHO. https://t.co/17vEJYO6t5
Good morning! ‚òï A federal judge has ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to give tribes hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency COVID-19 relief funds they should have gotten months ago. https://t.co/BY8TjNgJLV
History will treat elected officials who ban masks like the fools they are. School children will study how the president &amp; people like Governor Abbott make the pandemic worse than it needed to be &amp; let citizens needlessly die. https://t.co/ewb8iTL239

"Mnuchin is at the core of the Trump crime cabal along with Kushner, Pence and a few others. As predicted, they are using the tragedy of the coronavirus as pretext for a massive kleptocratic heist." -- @gaslitnation https://t.co/3a7hOE2Koy
If only we had a coronavirus task force https://t.co/1jLTXhct3v
I wouldn‚Äôt accuse Trump of actually *wanting* more people to get sick and die. But he must know, despite his stupidity, that what he and Pence are saying and doing will certainly have that result. That makes their conduct not just monstrous but criminal.   https://t.co/BbO7rmEGX8
Seriously how do we have a pandemic that is worse in Europe than in Asia and worse in the USA than in Europe and still people are saying the key variables are density and transit usage?
