This woman on the news just said, imagine if there was a medication that reduced your chances of getting COVID by 5x. Everyone would want that medication.  Well, that's wearing a mask.

@realTuckFrumper Well the 2016 race was about Hillary. This one will be about Trump,&amp; how his inaction in regards to Coronavirus, plus constantly downgrading it - has caused over 123,00 American lives to be lost &amp; more deaths are coming, no plan to solve this or unemployment -all not a good look
Italy down to only 190 Covid cases yesterday after their insane outbreak. France down to 81. Spain around 330. The USA? 33,399. Birdbrained nation.

If I die of covid tell my children I died a free man. I wasn't cowering at home. I died at a restaurant with my fork in my hand.
Also to be clear if you really think Black Lives Matter but you're not wearing a mask, I'm not sure what Black life you're talkin about since Black people are dying at the highest rates from Covid AND systemic racism means that they're treatment will likely be worse.

As usual, CNN’s headline detached from reality.  If it’s “possible” (id argue likely) that virus spread among people attending protests, of course that is going to spread to community.

Trump decided then that he was done w/ the pandemic. It was a source of unbearable narcissistic injury, so he erased it from his awareness. Out of sight, out of mind is his approach to life.

Hey guys... remember that time we managed to politicize wearing masks during a global pandemic??  😂😂😂😂😳😳
.@Keir_Starmer said at #PMQs that two thirds of people with coronavirus aren't being contacted by the govt's test and trace system He said 33,000 are estimated to have the virus in England but only 10,000 had been reached But the 33,000 figure needs to be treated with caution
There is a sad irony that the same elected officials who refused to listen to science, who mocked public health, who minimized the coronavirus, are desperate for science to bail out their negligence (which has led to unnecessary death and suffering) with vaccines and treatments.

@hughhewitt I'd usually agree w/you re: the test being the economy. But due to Trump's hamhanded mismanagement of the pandemic &amp; protests (e.g., St. John's), people don't like him. Unsophisticated voters will not discern problems w/Biden &amp; will vote for him &amp; against POTUS.

A rule of thumb: If you're lying about nonexistent voter fraud, if you're limiting polling places, if you're forcing people to line up to vote in a pandemic, even the old and the infirm, then it seems you're basically admitting most Americans don't want you to be president.

@EricTopol @medicalaxioms @COVID19Tracking 1/2 What I would really like to see is an examination of new cases and COVID hospitalizations.  Is the number of new cases growing because of more testing, or because we are in a uptick because of relaxed restrictions?   Are deaths falling because we are managing the disease
@MorganIllustr8s I've been chalking it up to COVID slowing a lot of these things down right now, cus never once before the pandemic have I ever had any issues with Zazzle. Still frustrating though.

@DrRPNishank @ugc_india @PIB_India @MIB_India @DDNewslive Why it is more important to conduct the exam in this pandemic situation when it is at peak. Why you all can't condiser the fact that every single person who will be present their at the time of examination will definitely get infected by the virus. Is it more important than life?

Who in their right mind would promote going without a mask to an event where there will be hundreds of people in a state that is experiencing a coronavirus spike? This is lunacy.
the plan? stop testing patients for coronavirus to make the number of active cases go down https://t.co/nvnb4tUuRx
Trump thinks #coronavirus disappears if he stops testing for it. If the absurdity isn’t obvious, replace “coronavirus” with “cancer” and say that sentence out loud.  Maybe he just doesn’t care about Americans dying if he can manipulate the number of confirmed cases.

The president of the United States doesn’t understand a basic fact about a pandemic that has killed 120,000 Americans. Unfortunately, he’s too ignorant to be embarrassed. https://t.co/5AUjfFKtJ5
1. The United States has had 121,000 deaths from Covid-19. With about 4% of the world’s population, that’s about 25% of the world’s deaths from this pandemic. That means over 100,000 of us (and counting) have died because of our government’s miserably bungled response. Go to # 2.
@BBCWorld #bunkerbabytrump @realDonaldTrump has pretty much sealed the fate of the people of the USA with his total disregard around the pandemic response. Trump thinks he is being clever, but the lack of a response and reopening too early spells disaster. Another fail effort by Trump. https://t.co/yORnxbZkcH
My hypothesis is that the left is picking up a lot of wins because: 1) there's a pandemic 2) there's a depression 3) people want total change/ the exact opposite of Trump 4) the protests
Number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 49,000 overnight.   Cases: 49,009 (+1,113) Recoveries: 19,658 (+417) Deaths: 2,573 (+38)
Trump calling COVID-19 the “Kung Flu” is stupid, racist and part of the reason he is losing this election in increasingly humiliating fashion. His material is no longer effective just self-degrading.

@DoughertyJeff @drewsilv “Asymptotic” and with “no apparent symptoms” are not the same thing; the WHO bungled the message and it was way too soon to declare either way.  Also, checking temps a couple of times does very little, as Covid fevers are often present at certain times of day but not others.

In Arizona, Trump continued to leave the misleading impression that more testing is responsible for the country’s large number of cases. But, as we have written, the U.S. positivity rate -- at 9% -- is higher than many other countries. https://t.co/7RKwadJy8H
